// Export mode has no server to do that gating (no middleware at runtime in
// a static export), so this is the client-side equivalent: wait for
// AuthProvider's mount-time /v1/me check (see lib/auth.tsx) to settle,
// then bounce to /sign-in if it didn't produce an identity. The public
// Landing page lives at "/" outside this gate (app/page.tsx).
